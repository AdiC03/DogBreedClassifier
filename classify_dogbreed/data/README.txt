This project was part of the Gen AI Externship at Cognizant (and Udacity).
I implmented a classifier, and filled out python functions to effectively 
classify and print out the results for various classifications. The main 
thing being classified are dog breeds (and if an object is a dog or not). 
The end goal is to compare 3 different convolutional neural networks: 
AlexNet, VGG, and ResNet. 

To set up:
pip install pillow
pip install torchvision

To run:
python check_images.py --dir pet_images
python check_images.py --dir uploaded_images
